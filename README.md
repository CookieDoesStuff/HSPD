# HSPD
HSPD(high speed dirt engine) is a game engine. Developing this engine taught me a lot of things,
from how to design an engine to wonders of the c++ programming language. However as this was my
first proper game engine(if we dont count the console game engine) it is designed very poorly
and I would not advise anyone to use this engine. Im putting this out there to document my work.
Currently Im working on a new engine and I will apply my new found knowledge to that engine.
